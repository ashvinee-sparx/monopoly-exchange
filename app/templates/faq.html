    <div id="duplicates" class="callout">
      <h5>I have a lot of duplicate tickets. Should I enter them all?</h5>
      <p>If you see that your duplicate hasn't been entered yet, yes! But if there are a lot of different entries for the same ticket, it might not be helpful to enter another one.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="ticket-claim" class="callout">
      <h5>I've found a ticket that I'd like to claim. How do I do that?</h5>
      <p>The ticket owner's Facebook page will be linked next to the ticket. Send them a message through Facebook to request the ticket.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="ticket-available" class="callout">
      <h5>How will I know when a ticket I need becomes available?</h5>
      <p>First, make sure that you mark the ticket that you need as "Needed" when you submit it. If another user has entered your ticket as "Available", you'll receive an email alert notifying you. Make sure that you've entered your email address in your account page.</p>
      <p>When you're notified of a match, come back to the directory, locate the ticket that's available, and contact that user through the Facebook profile they've provided.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="email" class="callout">
      <h5>Why should I enter my email address in the account page?</h5>
      <p>The directory will automatically send you an email when the tickets you need become available. You're not required to enter your email address though and your email will never be made available to the public. You can remove it at any time.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="fb-login" class="callout">
      <h5>Will you add other ways to login besides Facebook?</h5>
      <p>Honestly, it doesn't look like that'll happen this time around. This was the best solution to allow for users to connect with each other quickly and it keeps the amount of personal details you need to enter to a bare minimum. It couldn't get any easier.</p>
