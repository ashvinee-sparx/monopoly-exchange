      <h5>What in the world is this website?</h5>
      <p>This site is for players of the 2016 grocery store Monopoly game. If you're not sure what that is, don't feel bad. It might not be available in your area.</p>
      <p>For those that are playing, use this site to post and exchange tickets with your fellow gamers.</p>

    <div id="duplicates" class="callout">
      <h5>I have a lot of duplicate tickets. Should I enter them all?</h5>
      <p>If you see that your duplicate hasn't been entered yet, yes! But if there are a lot of different entries for the same ticket, it might not be helpful to enter another one.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="ticket-claim" class="callout">
      <h5>I've found a ticket that I'd like to claim. How do I do that?</h5>
      <p>The ticket owner's Facebook page will be linked next to the ticket. Send them a message through Facebook to request the ticket.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="ticket-available" class="callout">
      <h5>How will I know when a ticket I need becomes available?</h5>
      <p>Right now there are a few different ways this can happen. First, make sure that you mark the ticket that you need as "Needed" in your account page. If a user has your ticket, they could take the initiative and get in touch with you via Facebook. Second, search for the ticket you need in the "All Tickets" page and contact the user that has that ticket available.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="email" class="callout">
      <h5>Why should I enter my email address in the account page?</h5>
      <p>Soon a feature will be added that will automatically send an email when the tickets you need become available. You're not required to enter your email address though. Your email will never be made available to the public and you can remove it at any time.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="fb-login" class="callout">
      <h5>Will you add other ways to login besides Facebook?</h5>
      <p>Honestly, it doesn't look like that'll happen this time around. This was the best solution to allow for users to connect with each other quickly and it keeps the amount of personal details you need to enter to a bare minimum. It couldn't get any easier.</p>

    <div id="issue" class="callout">
      <h5>I think I found a website bug. Where can I report it?</h5>
      <p>Great question! All bugs should be entered into the <a href="https://github.com/jamigibbs/monopoly-exchange/issues">issues tracker.</a></p>
