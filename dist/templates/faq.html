      <h5>What in the world is this website?</h5>
      <p>This site is for players of the Jewel-Osco Monopoly game. If you're not sure what that is (or not even sure what Jewel-Osco is), I honestly feel a little bad for you because it's amazeballs.</p>
      <p>For those that are playing, use this site to post and exchange tickets with your fellow gamers.</p>

      <h5>I have a lot of duplicate tickets. Should I enter them all?</h5>
      <p>If you see that your duplicate hasn't been entered yet, yes! But if there are a lot of different entries for the same ticket, it might not be helpful to enter another one.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout">
      <h5>I've found a ticket that I'd like to claim. How do I do that?</h5>
      <p>The ticket owner's Facebook page will be linked next to the ticket. Send them a message through Facebook to request the ticket.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout">
      <h5>Will you add other ways to login besides Facebook?</h5>
      <p>Honestly, it doesn't look like that'll happen this time around. This was the best solution to allow for users to connect with each other about their tickets. Not to mention, it keeps the amount of personal details you need to enter to a bare minimum. It couldn't get any easier.</p>

      <h5>I think I found a website bug. Where can I report it?</h5>
      <p>Great question! All bugs should be entered into the <a href="https://github.com/jamigibbs/monopoly-exchange/issues">issues tracker.</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout">
      <h5>I can't seem to login on my mobile phone with Chrome?</h5>
      <p>This is a known issue and a big bummer. Until I'm able to find a workaround, try using another web browser on your mobile device or use your desktop computer instead.</p>
